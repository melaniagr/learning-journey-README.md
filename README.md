# My Learning Journey: Mathematics, Neuroscience & Neuroengineering (2025–2027)

## Overview
This folder documents my structured 18-month learning plan to develop expertise in:
- Computational Mathematics (Calculus → Differential Equations)
- Neuroscience (Fundamentals → Computational)
- Programming (Python for scientific computing)
- Physics & Neuroengineering (Circuits → Biosignals → BCIs)

## Why This Plan?
Developing skills in cognitive science. This plan integrates:
1. **Mathematics** — Foundation for signal processing and neural modeling
2. **Neuroscience** — Biological grounding for computational approaches
3. **Programming** — Implementation of algorithms and data analysis
4. **Physics** — Bridge between theory and hands-on hardware projects

## Structure
- **Parallel tracks** running simultaneously with integration points
- **Progressive difficulty** from calculus fundamentals to brain-computer interfaces
- **Time commitment**: 18–28 hours/week of structured learning

## Key Milestones

| Timeframe | Mathematics | Neuroscience | Programming | Physics |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Sep–Dec 2025 | Calculus I–II | — | Python basics | Phase 1–2: Circuits |
| Jan–Apr 2026 | Calculus III | Foundation | Python projects | Phase 3–4: Op-amps |
| May–Aug 2026 | Diff Equations | Systems | Data analysis | Phase 5–6: Biosignals |
| Sep 2026–Apr 2027 | Advanced | Computational | ML | Phase 7–8: Capstone |
